/// A convenience widget for drawing images and other decorations on [Material]
/// widgets, so that [InkWell] and [InkResponse] splashes will render over them.
///
/// Ink splashes and highlights, as rendered by [InkWell] and [InkResponse],
/// draw on the actual underlying [Material], under whatever widgets are drawn
/// over the material (such as [Text] and [Icon]s). If an opaque image is drawn
/// over the [Material] (maybe using a [Container] or [DecoratedBox]), these ink
/// effects will not be visible, as they will be entirely obscured by the opaque
/// graphics drawn above the [Material].
///
/// This widget draws the given [Decoration] directly on the [Material], in the
/// same way that [InkWell] and [InkResponse] draw there. This allows the
/// splashes to be drawn above the otherwise opaque graphics.
///
/// An alternative solution is to use a [MaterialType.transparency] material
/// above the opaque graphics, so that the ink responses from [InkWell]s and
/// [InkResponse]s will be drawn on the transparent material on top of the
/// opaque graphics, rather than under the opaque graphics on the underlying
/// [Material].
///
/// ## Limitations
///
/// This widget is subject to the same limitations as other ink effects, as
/// described in the documentation for [Material]. Most notably, the position of
/// an [Ink] widget must not change during the lifetime of the [Material] object
/// unless a [LayoutChangedNotification] is dispatched each frame that the
/// position changes. This is done automatically for [ListView] and other
/// scrolling widgets, but is not done for animated transitions such as
/// [SlideTransition].
///
/// Additionally, if multiple [Ink] widgets paint on the same [Material] in the
/// same location, their relative order is not guaranteed. The decorations will
/// be painted in the order that they were added to the material, which
/// generally speaking will match the order they are given in the widget tree,
/// but this order may appear to be somewhat random in more dynamic situations.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
///
/// The following example shows how an image can be printed on a [Material]
/// widget with an [InkWell] above it:
///
/// ```dart
/// Material(
///   color: Colors.grey[800],
///   child: Center(
///     child: InkImg(
///       image: const AssetImage('cat.jpeg'),
///       fit: BoxFit.cover,
///       width: 300.0,
///       height: 200.0,
///       child: InkWell(
///         onTap: () { /* ... */ },
///         child: const Align(
///           alignment: Alignment.topLeft,
///           child: Padding(
///             padding: EdgeInsets.all(10.0),
///             child: Text(
///               'KITTEN',
